<p>Balcalis marlenis Almanzar, also known as Cardi B, was born on October 11, 1992. Her father is Dominican and her mother is Trinidadian/Spaniard. She only has one sibiling. Her sister, Hennessy. Together they lived in The Bonx, New York.</p>

  <h2>Fame and success:</h2>
  <p>She became an Internet celebrity after several of her posts and videos went viral on Vine and Instagram. From 2015 to 2017, she appeared as a regular cast member on the VH1 reality television series Love & Hip Hop: New York to follow her music aspirations. She then released two mixtapes—Gangsta Bitch Music, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2.</p>

<p>Cardi B has since earned three number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100:
  <ul>
    <li>"Bodak Yellow" made her the second female rapper to top the chart with a solo output—following Lauryn Hill in 1998.</li>
      <li>"I Like It" made her the only female rapper to attain multiple number-one songs on the chart.</li>
        <li>and her Maroon 5 collaboration "Girls Like You" made her the sixth female artist to achieve three number-one singles on the chart during the 2010s.</li>
      </ul>
          Her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy (2018), on which the former two songs are included, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, broke several streaming records, and was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. Critically acclaimed, the album won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, making Cardi B the only woman to win the award as a solo artist. Also in 2018, Time included her on their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.  </p>

<p>Among her numerous accolades, Cardi B has won a Grammy Award, seven Billboard Music Awards—the most of any female rapper, nine BET Hip Hop Awards—the most of any female rapper, three American Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, and two Guinness World Records.</p>

<h2>Before all the fame and fortune:</h2>
<p>She was raised in the Highbridge neighborhood of the South Bronx, and spent much time at her paternal grandmother's home in Washington Heights, which she credits with giving her "such a thick […] accent." Almánzar developed the stage name "Cardi B" as a derivation of Bacardi, a rum brand that was formerly her nickname. As a youth, Cardi B was a member of the Bloods and has said she was a gang member since the age of 16. However, she has stated ever since that she would not encourage joining a gang. She went on to attend Renaissance High School for Musical Theater & Technology, a vocational high school on the Herbert H. Lehman High School campus.<p>

<p>During her teenage years, Cardi B was employed at an Amish Market in Tribeca. She then began stripping at the age of 19. Upon being fired from the supermarket, her former manager recommended she work at a strip club. Cardi B has said that becoming a stripper was positive for her life in many ways: "It really saved me from a lot of things. When I started stripping I went back to school." She says stripping was her only way out in which she earned enough money to escape her dire situation and get an education. She has explained that she become a stripper in order to escape poverty and domestic violence, having been in an abusive relationship at the time. She attended Borough of Manhattan Community College before eventually dropping out. While stripping, Cardi B lied to her mother by telling her she was making money babysitting.</p>
